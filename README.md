# Optimized-MDVRP
"Using Genetic Algorithms for Multi-depot Vehicle Routing" paper implementation.

![Github Action Status](https://github.com/Nikronic/Optimized-MDVRP/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

**MDVRP** is a **multi-objective optimization** task that the goal is to assign a number of vehicles which are distributed in multi depots in search to the customers meanwhile **minimizing** the number of car used and distance traveled regarding some **constraints** such as vehicle weight threshold.


First, initial attempt was implementing the Using **Genetic Algorithms** for Multi-depot Vehicle Routing paper, but I noticed that the *algorithm could be refined in many aspects*, so I applied the desired modification in *mutation* and *replacement* so that **I achieved better results** in term of metrics provided in the original paper.

This project was part of the *Computational Intelligence* course.
